# ðŸ‘• Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories (T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot).

âœ… Results
Test Accuracy: 88.76%

Model: Custom CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Training Dataset: 60,000 images

Test Dataset: 10,000 images

ðŸ“Œ Key Observations
The model achieved a well-generalized performance across most categories.

A few misclassifications occurred due to:

Visual similarity (e.g., Shirt vs T-shirt/top, Coat vs Pullover)

Low resolution (28Ã—28 pixels) and grayscale images

Some blurry or ambiguous samples

Despite these challenges, the model demonstrated strong classification ability with minimal confusion.
